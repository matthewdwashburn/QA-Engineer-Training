# Project Requirements Document: Revature Expense Manager

## Overview
**Revature Expense Manager** is a console-based expense tracking system designed for small teams or organizations. It features two distinct applications:
- A **Python-based Employee App** for submitting and managing personal expense reports.
- A **Java-based Manager App** for reviewing, approving, or denying submitted expenses.

The system uses a **shared SQLite database** to ensure consistent data access and persistence across both applications.

---

## Technologies Used
- **Python 3.x** – Employee CLI interface and data entry
- **Java 17+** – Manager CLI interface and expense approval logic
- **SQLite** – Lightweight relational database for shared persistence
- **Git** – Version control software for collaboration facilitation

## User Stories

### Employee App (Python)
- As an employee, I want to log in with my credentials so that I can securely access my expense reports.
- As an employee, I want to submit a new expense with details about amount and description so that I can request reimbursement or track spending.
- As an employee, I want to view the status of my submitted expenses so that I know whether they are pending, approved, or denied.
- As an employee, I want to edit or delete expenses that are still pending so that I can correct mistakes before they are reviewed.
- As an employee, I want to view a history of all my approved and denied expenses so that I can track my financial activity over time.

### Manager App (Java)
- As a manager, I want to log in securely so that I can access and manage employee expense reports.
- As a manager, I want to view a list of all pending expenses so that I can review them efficiently.
- As a manager, I want to approve or deny submitted expenses so that I can manage reimbursements appropriately.
- As a manager, I want to add comments to expense decisions so that employees understand the reasoning behind approvals or denials.
- As a manager, I want to generate reports by employee, category, or date so that I can analyze spending trends and make informed decisions.

## Shared Application MVPs
- Shared SQLite schema with normalized tables
- Role-based access: employees vs. managers
- Expense lifecycle: submission → review → approval/denial
- Basic reporting and feedback mechanisms
- Work saved in a remote repository
